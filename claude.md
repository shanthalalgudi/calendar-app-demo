## Workflow

1. Think through the problem. Write a plan in tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should be a checklist of todo items.
3. Check in with me before starting work—I'll verify the plan.
4. Then, complete the todos one by one, marking them off as you go.
5. At every step, explain what you changed.
6. Keep every change simple and minimal.
7. At the end, add a review section in todo.md summarizing the changes.
